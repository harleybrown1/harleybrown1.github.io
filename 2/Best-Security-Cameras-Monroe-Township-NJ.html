<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
