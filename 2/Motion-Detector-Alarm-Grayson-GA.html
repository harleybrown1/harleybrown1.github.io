<p>The loudest of the clever alarm systems we evaluated, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at cautioning anyone in your home and those neighboring that there's an issue. Throughout screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adjusted to represent animals, too. The alarm is just one of 2 we tested that includes an external siren, and we're amazed that it also features a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further preventing anyone from trying to break in to your residential or commercial property.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you stroll by.
