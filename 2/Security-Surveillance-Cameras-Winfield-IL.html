<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.
