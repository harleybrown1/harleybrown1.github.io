<h3>Home Security Monitoring Service in New York</h3>
<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for one month.

<p>Analog high definition cameras are a great alternative for companies to upgrade from analog CCTV that has currently been wired utilizing coax cable television or CAT-5 cable television. AHD cameras use the very same RG59 or RG6 cable as traditional CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable with video baluns can likewise be used. While pro monitoring costs more, it's more secure.
