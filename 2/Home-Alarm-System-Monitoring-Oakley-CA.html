<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
