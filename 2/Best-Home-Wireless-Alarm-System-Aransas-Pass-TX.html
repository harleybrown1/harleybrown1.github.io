The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for example. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively high rate: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for one month of video history.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensing units, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
