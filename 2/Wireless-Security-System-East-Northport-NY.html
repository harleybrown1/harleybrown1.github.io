<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
