Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
