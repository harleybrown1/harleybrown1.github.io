<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides complimentary perks like person detection, familiar-face alerts, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 per month.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked just about half of the camera and the time regularly disconnected from the network several times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine).
