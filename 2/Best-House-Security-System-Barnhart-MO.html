<p>The loudest of the wise alarm systems we evaluated, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at warning anybody in your home and those neighboring that there's a problem. During screening, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adapted to account for animals, too.

Sensors - The majority of clever alarm manufacturers offer a mix of sensing units in an alarm package, so you'll need to exercise the combination you need for your residential or commercial property.
