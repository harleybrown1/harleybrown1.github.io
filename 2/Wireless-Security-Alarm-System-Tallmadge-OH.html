<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
