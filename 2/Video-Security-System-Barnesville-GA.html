<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats given that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant offender for short battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capability is a bit minimal to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>This awesome smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout screening, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly triggering when motion was detected. We like that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get pricey. It's likewise worth noting that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>
