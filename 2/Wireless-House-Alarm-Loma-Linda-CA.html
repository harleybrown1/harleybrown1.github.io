<p>We required guards for our yearly Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to begin the heating unit at 5am. The first guard showed up early so he could look at the whole area and speak with me about my issues. He was expert, really encouraging and courteous. The 2nd guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I got here in the morning to get the event started, he was also expert, reassuring and polite. We were really delighted with your service and I will suggest that we call on your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't fret as soon as after leaving our home in your hands.</p>
