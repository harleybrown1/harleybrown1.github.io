<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of complimentary storage, and utilize 2 AA batteries that can last as much as two years. Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.
