<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
