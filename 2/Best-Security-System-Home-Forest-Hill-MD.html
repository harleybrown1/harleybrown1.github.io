<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>

<p>In The Sims, a burglar alarm will cover an entire space when placed indoors. If put on an outside wall, it will cover a 5-tile radius. When a provider enables clients to monitor their own homes, this is called self-monitoring." Consumers can monitor their homes with the help of motion detectors, sensing units, and security cameras.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. Since it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Unfortunately I purchased 4 cameras that look just like these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Young boy was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is really excellent. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
