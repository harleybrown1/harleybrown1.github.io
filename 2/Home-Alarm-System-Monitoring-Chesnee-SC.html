Unlike with analogue cameras, details such as number plates are easily legible. At 11 Mpix, forensic quality images are made where each hand on a person can be distinguished. They can be set up to cover a broad location where usually several analogue cameras would have been required since of the much greater resolutions readily available with these types of cameras.</p>
<p>While it hits the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K footage given that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, however this is still far and away the sharpest security camera we have actually seen in action, wireless or otherwise.

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
