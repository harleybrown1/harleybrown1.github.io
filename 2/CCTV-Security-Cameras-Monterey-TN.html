<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much photo details as 1080p.
