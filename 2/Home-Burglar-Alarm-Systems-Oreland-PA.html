<p>Some home insurance coverage companies need you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. Nevertheless, alarms needed by insurance companies must abide by the European Standard EN 50131 and should be installed by an NSI or SSAIB recognized installer. All of the smart alarms on the market presently do not adhere to the European Requirement, and as they're created to be self-installed, they won't be accepted by your insurer. By integrating LiveWatch DIY security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security competing with other big names in the industry. During our hands-on screening of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather easy to set up and use-- but not quite as easy as brand names like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
