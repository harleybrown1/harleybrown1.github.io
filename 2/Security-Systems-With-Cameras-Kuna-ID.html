<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation.

Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
