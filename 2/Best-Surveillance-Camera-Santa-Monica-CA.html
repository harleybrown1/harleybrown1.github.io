We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline.
