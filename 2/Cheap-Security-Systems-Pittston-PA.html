<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics given that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest offender for brief battery life by far.

Flood lights can deter vandals or scare them away, but as a single tool, they are more for your comfort than for home protection.</p>
