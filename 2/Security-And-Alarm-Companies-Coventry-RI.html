Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.

(You need to play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, canines shout, felines squeal, children cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>
