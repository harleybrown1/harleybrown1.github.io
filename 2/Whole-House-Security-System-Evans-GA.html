<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and for that reason uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video in your area on an SD card.
