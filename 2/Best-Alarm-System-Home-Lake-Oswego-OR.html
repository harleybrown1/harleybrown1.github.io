<h3>Home Monitoring Security Systems in Lake Oswego OR</h3>
<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control panel (normally positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensors have been triggered, smart alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have actually been activated, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially annoying your neighbours). Nevertheless, clever alarms do need a center that allows the various components to wirelessly link. But for many clever alarms this hub can be positioned throughout your home.</p>

It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will lower criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
