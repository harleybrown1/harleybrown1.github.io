<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and reduce criminal activity. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was faulty, and so we might review this evaluation.
