The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers cast doubt on the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of permitting three or four totally free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>At $24.99 per month, SimpliSafe's top-tier bundle is still very economical compared to the other companies on this list. It's practically a steal.
