<p>3 huge advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, portability and impermanence. Occupants, unlike homeowners, generally avoid making irreversible modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other parts can quickly be set up at different residential or commercial properties later, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too.
