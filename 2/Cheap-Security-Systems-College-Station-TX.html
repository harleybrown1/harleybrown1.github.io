<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
