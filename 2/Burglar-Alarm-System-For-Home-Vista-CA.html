<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to cops capability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops response to alarmed properties) a inefficient and pricey method to burglary decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
