<p>Best Expert Installation Security Company - While some security systems offer easy DIY installation, other companies offer (and in some cases require) expert installation. Professional installation is offered for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio typically work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a pretty standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>
