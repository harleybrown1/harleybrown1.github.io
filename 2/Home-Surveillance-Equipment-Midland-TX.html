<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
