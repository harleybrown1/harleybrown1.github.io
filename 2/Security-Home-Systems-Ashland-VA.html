<h3>Home Security System Review in Virginia</h3>
<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with a tempting opportunity for criminal misuse. In 1997, for example, a top-level cops official in Washington, DC was captured utilizing police databases to collect information on customers of a gay club. By searching for the license plate varieties of cars parked at the club and researching the backgrounds of the lorries' owners, he attempted to blackmail clients who were married. Imagine what someone like that might do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
