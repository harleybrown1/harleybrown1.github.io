<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
