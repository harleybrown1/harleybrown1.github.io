<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by.
