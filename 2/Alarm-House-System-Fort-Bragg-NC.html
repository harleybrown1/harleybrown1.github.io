<p>We searched for DIY systems that offered expert monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies provide heavily reduced or complimentary hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we found no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some people might wish to register for service just for when they or their partner runs out town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in overall control of the equipment you use, in addition to how and when you pay and use for monitoring services.</p>
