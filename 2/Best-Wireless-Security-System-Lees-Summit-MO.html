<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational crime avoidance developed to avoid both personal and home criminal activity and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will decrease criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
