<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription.

The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And regardless of having an appealing price and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
