Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you opt for a three-year contract, however since Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge dedication.

From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it appear like you're home - and you'll also get an alert if your Echo speakers hear the noise of an alarm, or damaged glass.</p>
