<p>Multiple monitors were set up within the new command center with a single monitor appointed to alarm display screens. As soon as any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the closest camera to that location would be shown on that specific monitor. The chance that the repaired camera would be pointed in the direction of the event depends upon the initial requirements for location of coverage. If there are 3 select emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single set camera can just view one. This creates a one in 3 chance of capturing a particular event on video (either live or recorded).

These type of sensors are extremely typical and are discovered either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can usually be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
