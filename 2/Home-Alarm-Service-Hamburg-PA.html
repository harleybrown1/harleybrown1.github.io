<p>Multiple monitors were set up within the new command center with a single monitor appointed to alarm display screens. As soon as any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the closest camera to that location would be shown on that specific monitor. The chance that the repaired camera would be pointed in the direction of the event depends upon the initial requirements for location of coverage.

This creates a one in 3 chance of capturing a particular event on video (either live or recorded).
