<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
