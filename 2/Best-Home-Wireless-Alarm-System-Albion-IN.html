<p>We don't hide equipment costs by rolling them into a high monthly rate. At Smith Thompson Security we believe the ideal thing to do is, is to reveal you the cost of the equipment and monitoring rate individually. That way you REALLY understand what you're spending.

<p>If you decide for a professionally set up system, a security company will make more money. Typically, in this circumstances, a security company will usually give you the equipment for free and provide you with a free installation. Nevertheless, in exchange, they will need you to sign a long-term monitoring arrangement. For that reason, you will need to be ready to sign a long-term contract and spend for that service. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified intruders or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Note that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so examine ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to opt for a Do It Yourself system or opt for an expertly installed system, you'll need to pay a month-to-month or annual  charge if you require monitoring, and in some cases, you'll be hit with a regular monthly fee to pay off the cost of hardware elements. With the majority of Do It Yourself systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can prevent any month-to-month fees if you decide to self-monitor. If you include monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month. If you dedicate to a three-year contract, the rate of the Nest service drops to $19 each month. Ring's Protect Plus plan opts for $10 monthly and doesn't need an agreement.</p>
