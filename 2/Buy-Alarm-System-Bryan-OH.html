<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, signals, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
