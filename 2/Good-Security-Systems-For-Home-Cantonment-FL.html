<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police reaction to alarmed homes) a pricey and inefficient  method to robbery reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
