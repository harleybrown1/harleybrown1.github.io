<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
