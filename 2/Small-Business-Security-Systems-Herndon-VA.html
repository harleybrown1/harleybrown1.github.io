<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to shoulder a share of the cost.

However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to police capability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize cops reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and pricey technique to burglary reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
