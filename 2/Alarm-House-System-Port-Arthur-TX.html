<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, signals, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for one month.
