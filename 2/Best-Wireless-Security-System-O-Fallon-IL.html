<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity prevention designed to avoid both individual and residential or commercial property criminal activity and can be used in location of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>TP-Link's Kasa Web cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that might equal a few of our top picks. It likewise comes with two days of complimentary cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can pack in clips of approximately 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control board and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a should for use when you're away from home, but you shouldn't need to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it easy to arm and deactivate the system.
