<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an appealing price and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
