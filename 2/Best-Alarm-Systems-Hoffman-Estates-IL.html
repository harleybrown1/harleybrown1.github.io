<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense avoidance designed to prevent both individual and residential or commercial property criminal offense and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will lower criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
