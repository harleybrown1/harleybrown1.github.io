Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
