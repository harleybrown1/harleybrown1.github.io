<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the specific same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
