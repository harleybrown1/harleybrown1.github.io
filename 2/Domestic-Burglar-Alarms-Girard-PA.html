Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to save and the length of time you plan to keep documented video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area rapidly.
