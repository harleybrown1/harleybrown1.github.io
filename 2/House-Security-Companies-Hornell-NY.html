<h3>Wireless Security Alarm System in Hornell NY</h3>

<p>Since the glass housing doesn't obstruct, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they make up for it in abilities. In addition to being great for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for low-light and infrared given that the glass housing doesn't hinder the lens.

<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize a violation. When a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
