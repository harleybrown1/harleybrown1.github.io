<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even set off false alarms. False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they occur often enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>

What you typically find at stores are consumer-grade cameras, which usually come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and cost less than a thousand dollars (US $) for the set.

The video recorder must be acquired independently, and commercial grade recorders start at about $500 (US $) and can range approximately $5000 depending on the amount of storage, camera connection, and image processing functions.</p>
