<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level.

HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
