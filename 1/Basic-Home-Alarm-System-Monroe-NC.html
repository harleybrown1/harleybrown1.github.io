When people are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself."
