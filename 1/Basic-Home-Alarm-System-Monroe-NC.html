<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however extensive modifications to the character of our public areas. When people are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals might find out to be mindful about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers.
