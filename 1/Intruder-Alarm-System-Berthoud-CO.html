<h2>Keeping Your Family Safe Berthoud</h2>

A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in a surrounding zone within a brief time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to ask for a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
