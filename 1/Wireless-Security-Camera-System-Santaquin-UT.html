<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however extensive changes to the character of our public areas.

You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals might discover to be mindful about the periodicals and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers.

<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a need to for use when you're far from home, however you shouldn't have to fumble with your phone when you're coming and going.
