<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
