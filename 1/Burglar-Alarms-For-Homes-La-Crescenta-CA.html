Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
