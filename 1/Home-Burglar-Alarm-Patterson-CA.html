<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
