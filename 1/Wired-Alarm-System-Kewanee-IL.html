<p>3 huge advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their portability, expandability and impermanence. Renters, unlike house owners, usually prevent making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other parts can easily be established at various homes in the future, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new elements too. Wireless security strategies also permit push-button control of the system and general home automation.
