<p>Video cameras, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are ending up being an increasingly more prevalent feature of American life. Fears of terrorism and the schedule of ever-cheaper cameras have sped up the pattern even more.

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal activity avoidance created to avoid both individual and residential or commercial property criminal offense and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will decrease criminal offense and boost arrest, without displacing crime to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
