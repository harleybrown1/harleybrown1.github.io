<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
