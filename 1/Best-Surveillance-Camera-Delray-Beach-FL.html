If video belongs to your monitoring plan, it can be a big advantage in case of a burglary due to the fact that the monitoring company can report visual confirmation of the activity straight to the cops to expedite the dispatching of personnel.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
