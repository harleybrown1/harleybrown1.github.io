Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you plan to save and for how long you plan to keep recorded video. The video is going to eat up storage space rapidly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution.

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the specific same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current.
