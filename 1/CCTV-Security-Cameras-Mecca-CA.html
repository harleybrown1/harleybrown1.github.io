<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a great security camera and an extraordinary value. It gets an Exceptional score for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
