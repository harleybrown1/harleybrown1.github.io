<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone gadget or in tandem with the rest of your security system. When somebody rings the doorbell, it activates the doorbell camera.

Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
