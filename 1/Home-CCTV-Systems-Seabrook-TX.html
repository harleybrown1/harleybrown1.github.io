<p>No false alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the police for a false alarm. Because the house owner is in charge of the system, authorities are only gotten in touch with if there's a genuine emergency situation. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will call authorities if a house owner can't validate a false alarm. If  police are contacted for a false alarm, property owners might have to pay a fine for dispatching authorities unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for incorrect alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>

In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private security guard. A number of cities also need a license to even run a home and own security system.
