<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to store and the length of time you prepare to keep taped footage.
