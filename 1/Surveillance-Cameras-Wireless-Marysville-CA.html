<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being watched by the authorities - or conscious they may be enjoyed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "understanding that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people might discover to be careful about the periodicals and books they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers. They might likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings went through extended surveillance.</p>
