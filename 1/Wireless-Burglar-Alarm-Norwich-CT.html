We have actually found good deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll discover more than 30 brand names offered. Often you don't have a choice. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT use only professional installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a DIY alternative. ADT does not have the strongest customer care reputation among the companies we thought about, acquiring more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked the majority of this as much as the truth that ADT has a number of million more consumers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
