On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will contact authorities if a property owner can't validate a false alarm. If  police are contacted for a false alarm, property owners might have to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly. A self-monitored home limitations the potential for subsequent charges and false alarms.</p>
