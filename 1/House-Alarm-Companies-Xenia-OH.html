We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top areas.

The Spot can record as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, despite showing up in the app's activity timeline.

That said, we have definitely no other qualms about the Swann's motion detection qualifications - it's satisfies in terms of level of sensitivity, avoiding incorrect positives in our tests and throwing in heat detection as an added benefit.
