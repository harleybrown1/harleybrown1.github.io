ADT is among the more expensive home security companies, with pricey video monitoring and steep early termination charges. But ADT is understood to offer deals that alleviate the cost of equipment, that makes the general cost for a 36-month contract a lot more affordable.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
