<p>As for how to utilize one, they work the same as many other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup. Often you do not even need to hardwire them, depending upon which model you choose. As with any security system, the more equipment you add, the pricier it gets.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
