<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
