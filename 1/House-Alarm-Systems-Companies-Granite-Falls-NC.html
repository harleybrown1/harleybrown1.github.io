<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends potential offenders are less most likely to devote criminal offense if they believe they are being watched or have a greater danger of being collared. This is also known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense prevention technique, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by modifying a range of systems such as increasing the risk of an offender being captured, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing benefits from crime commission, and minimizing justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
