<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Excellent clearness. I wished to establish viewing on my cell phone but had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter signals, for instance. However, those features come at a relatively high cost: $5 per month ($50 per year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for 30 days of video history.  For each extra camera, the membership is marked down to about half of the preliminary charge. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 per month for person detection with 1 month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and features storage up to 31 days.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
