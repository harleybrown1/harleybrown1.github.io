Because it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it just gets activated when it captures motion from something emitting infrared energy, i.e., animals and people.

However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. When making a choice, they are the only company of the four mentioned that utilizes a mix of wired and wireless innovation so keep that in mind.</p>
