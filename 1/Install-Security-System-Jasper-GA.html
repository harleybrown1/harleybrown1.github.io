Because it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it just gets activated when it captures motion from something emitting infrared energy, i.e., animals and people.

It also includes two days of totally free cloud storage (with a choice for more ), which can pack in clips of up to 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. When making a choice, they are the only company of the four mentioned that utilizes a mix of wired and wireless innovation so keep that in mind.</p>
