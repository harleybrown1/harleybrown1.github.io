<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is taped. The systems with video storage normally include either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage alternative conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the gadget itself. This choice is usually cost-free. A cloud storage option saves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is generally a paid service and the variety of hours it will store will depend upon just how much cloud storage you are willing to spend for.</p>
