<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, theft, and scams. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately switch off the heater. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to frighten prospective robbers.</p>
