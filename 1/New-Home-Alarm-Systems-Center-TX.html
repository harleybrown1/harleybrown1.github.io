Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I checked, consisting of clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate in between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a regular camera image. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the fact, which indicates that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and use up a great deal of taping storage area. So much, in reality, that they need about 4 times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is necessary.</p>
