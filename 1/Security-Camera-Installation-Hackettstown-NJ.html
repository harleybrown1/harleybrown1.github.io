<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
