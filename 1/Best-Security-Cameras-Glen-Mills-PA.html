<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or conscious they might be watched at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people might discover to be cautious about the books and periodicals they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, druggies or members."
