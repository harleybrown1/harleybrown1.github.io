This system might not be the best fit if you have a large yard or sheds to protect. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q doesn't require a base station-- it links directly to any Wi-Fi network. But you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is readily available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web internet browser.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
