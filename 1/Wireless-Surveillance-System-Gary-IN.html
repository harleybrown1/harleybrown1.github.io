<p>Keep in mind though, Vivint is not a Do It Yourself system-- it does need expert installation. Also, the equipment is a bit expensive, however you certainly get what you spend for. The good news is, their monthly monitoring cost is on-par with other top brand names.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
