<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

Renters, unlike house owners, generally prevent making permanent changes to their homes.
