<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
