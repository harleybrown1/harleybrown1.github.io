<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of straight plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need extra cables. DVR systems are hard to scale up because as soon as every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to acquire a totally new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system. DVRs likewise require that the linked cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to break down.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
