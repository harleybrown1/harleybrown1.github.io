<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search technology that is quickly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For beginners, Deep Knowing permits someone to find what they are searching for without needing to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the components you are looking for in the recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we merely type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have an effective service for capturing criminals and gathering proof.</p>

Many recent outdoor Wi-Fi cameras provide assistance for IFTTT (If This Then That), an internet service that uses small programs (applets) that you develop to have the camera communicate with other IFTTT-enabled gadgets. For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a lamp indoors or trigger an external siren when the camera finds motion.</p>
