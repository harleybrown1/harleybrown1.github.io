<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
