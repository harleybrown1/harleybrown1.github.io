<p>Some wireless security companies have additional features and prepare for an added cost. If you  want to have constant video recording and cloud storage for your security cameras, you'll have to pay a regular monthly or yearly  charge. Many of these offers do not consist of an agreement, but some may need an agreement for the equipment or expert monitoring services. For example, Scout only provides one security camera (and it's for indoor usage only). If you want a few more sets of eyes on your property, however, Scout Alarm incorporates with Nest Cams, which can send out motion notifications to your Scout app.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
