<p>The majority of contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which allow operators to reap a few of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog video footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capacity, makes it a lot easier to browse archived video, and likewise allows users to stream video over a network for remote watching from multiple locations. Often, the mere presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated burglars. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more identified intruders. If intruders can not see any security cameras, they may also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
