<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you don't currently have an Arlo camera or more in location, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can indicate there are range issues.</p>
