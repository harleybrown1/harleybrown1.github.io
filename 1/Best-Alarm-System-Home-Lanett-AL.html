<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police ability to collar intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize authorities reaction to alarmed properties) a expensive and inefficient  method to theft decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>

For instance, you can have a wise plug turn on a lamp inside or trigger an external siren when the camera detects motion.</p>
