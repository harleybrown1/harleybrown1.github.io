<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
<p>Exits and Entrances - Security cameras placed at the entrances and exits to your business will track not just who enters your business, but the length of time they stay. The specific positioning near the entrance and exit is essential also. Attempt to install the camera near an indication or other eye-catching function where most people will look as they get in or exit the building. This will increase the opportunity of recording a full photo of each person's face.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions.
