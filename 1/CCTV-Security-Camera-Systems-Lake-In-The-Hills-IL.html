<p>SimpliSafe may be too limited for you if you have a larger home or residential or commercial property you want to keep an eye on.

You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the person being seen know they're being enjoyed, and you can pick to tape video or pictures and conserve them to your wise gadget on a whim.</p>
