<p>Discover how to develop, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and reduce criminal offense. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.
