<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to save and how long you plan to keep recorded footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage when you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
