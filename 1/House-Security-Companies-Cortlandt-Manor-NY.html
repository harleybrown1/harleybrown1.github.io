<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems usually include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's washroom. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station if a client is having problem. This is an easy switch that is typically open or normally closed. Most of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and signals, sensors, gain access to control, and so on.
