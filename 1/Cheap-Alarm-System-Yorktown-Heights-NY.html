The $260 Basics plan includes the base station, a keypad, four entry sensing units, one motion sensing unit, a backyard indication, and 2 window decals. For $15 monthly, you can include ongoing expert monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline.

(You should play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines groan, felines shriek, children weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
