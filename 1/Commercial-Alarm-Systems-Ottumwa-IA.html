<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
