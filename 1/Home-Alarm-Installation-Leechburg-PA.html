<p>Considering that the glass housing does not obstruct, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they offset it in capabilities. Along with being excellent for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for low-light and infrared since the glass housing doesn't hamper the lens. With some, it's hard to inform at a glimpse where they have actually been aimed, so they can give a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their real field of view. Setting up a video surveillance system with a few of these is a terrific option for a number of different configurations.</p>

You'll also pay more for pro installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, specifically for cameras. And to be sincere, we're not extremely impressed by ADT's cameras in the first location. What you're spending for is primarily that huge name in blue.</p>
