<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
