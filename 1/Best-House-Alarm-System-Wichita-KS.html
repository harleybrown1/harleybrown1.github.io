<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers understand that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
