<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

<p>A self-monitored home security system counts on the house owner to watch their home and contact authorities in the event of an emergency situation. A self-monitored system does not suggest a property owner needs to sacrifice any functions.

This along with backyard indications and window sticker labels (sold on Amazon) may suffice to deter small time scoundrels.
