<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and decrease crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, nevertheless, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we may revisit this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud.

IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
