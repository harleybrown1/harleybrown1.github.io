<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a great security camera and a phenomenal value. It receives an Excellent rating for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does use a Total Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is found. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
