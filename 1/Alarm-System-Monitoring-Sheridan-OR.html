As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
