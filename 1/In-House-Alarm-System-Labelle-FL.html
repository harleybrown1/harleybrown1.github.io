<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in consumer reviews, and it provides a crisp picture up to 32 feet.

A lot of wise cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but couple of make things as basic as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives simpler and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
