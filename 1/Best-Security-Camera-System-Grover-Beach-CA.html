CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to upset can be reduced by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a culprit being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing benefits from crime commission, and reducing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
