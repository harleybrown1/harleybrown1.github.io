Here's a look at the differences in between the two kinds of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more stable than they used to be.

So much, in fact, that they need about 4 times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more cash if extended video storage is very important.</p>
