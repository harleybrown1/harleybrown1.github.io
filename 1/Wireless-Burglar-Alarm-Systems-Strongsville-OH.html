<p>Besides resolution, likewise think about the field of vision. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are created equal. Depending upon the lens' field of vision, it can see between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a big variety in terms of the camera's vision cone. If you want to see a large location, you should consider a camera with a very broad field of view. The capability to mechanically pan and tilt the camera is a terrific possession as well.</p>

Abode, ring, and nest won't charge you a thing for leaving monitoring in the hands of their call centers.</p>
