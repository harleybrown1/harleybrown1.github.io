The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall.
