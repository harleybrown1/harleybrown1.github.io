<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
