<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
